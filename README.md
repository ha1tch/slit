# slit
## A trivial tool for trivial SQLite3 tasks

A simple command for basic sqlite data handling

slit is a simple command to insert, delete, and extract data from basic 
sqlite3 databases, following some minimum conventions and a unix-like,
regular syntax that abstracts the user from the bore of dealing with 
SQL for the most simple tasks.
